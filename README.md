# AdventOfCode
A repo where I'm storing all of my submissions to the Advent of Code challenge

Will create folders for each language.

Planning to have all my submissions for current and future AoC in one folder - If I want to check the specific result of one day I need to be able to through my project to run a
specific day at a specific year

I'll need to create a CLI that will have the following:
-- it accepts a command argument and by default will run the code for the current day
-- it could accept a day number as an argument -> which will run the code for the provided day in this current year
-- it could accept the year as an argument -> which will run the current day at the provided year
-- it could accept both year and day - there must be one argument only and day & year can be 
-- separated by anything + there is no order (ex: <command> 1/2024 or <command> 2024-01 etc)
This should provide me with my results for both parts on that day.
